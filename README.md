# Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier ðŸŽ½ðŸ‘žðŸ‘œ

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based deep learning model built to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset** into 10 categories:

- T-shirt/top ðŸ‘•  
- Trouser ðŸ‘–  
- Pullover ðŸ§¥  
- Dress ðŸ‘—  
- Coat ðŸ§¥  
- Sandal ðŸ‘¡  
- Shirt ðŸ‘”  
- Sneaker ðŸ‘Ÿ  
- Bag ðŸ‘œ  
- Ankle boot ðŸ‘¢  

We also created a **Streamlit UI** for real-time testing of the trained model.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The CNN model used here:

1. **Conv2D layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU)**
2. **MaxPooling (2x2)**
3. **Conv2D layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU)**
4. **MaxPooling (2x2)**
5. **Flatten layer**
6. **Fully Connected (128 neurons, ReLU + Dropout)**
7. **Output Layer (10 classes with Softmax)**

This design helps the model extract hierarchical features from images and classify them effectively.

## ðŸ”„ Preprocessing

- All Fashion MNIST images are **28x28 grayscale**.  
- Transformations applied:
  - Convert to **Tensor**
  - Normalize pixel values to **[-1, 1]**

Training

Dataset: Fashion MNIST

Optimizer: Adam (lr = 0.001)

Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss

Batch Size: 64

Epochs: 10 (can be increased for higher accuracy)

Accuracy

The model achieved around 92% test accuracy after training.

---

Testing

For evaluation:

Model predictions compared against test labels.

Accuracy calculated as:
accuracy = (correct_predictions / total_samples) * 100

---

Streamlit UI

We created an interactive UI (app.py) using Streamlit:

Upload any 28x28 grayscale image or a resized image.

The model predicts one of the 10 fashion categories.

The UI displays the predicted class.

How It Works

train.py â†’ Train the CNN model and save it as Model/fashion_cnn.pth

app.py â†’ Load the saved model and test it on uploaded images.

requirements.txt â†’ Contains required dependencies.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Add data augmentation for more robustness.

Try transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet) for better accuracy.

Expand dataset with real-world images for generalization.
